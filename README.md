## Project Overview

Sparse-vLLM is an inference framework built with sparsity as the first design principle. Instead of layering sparse methods on top of a conventional KV cache, it rethinks cache layout, controller flow, and kernels so that multiple sparse mechanisms can plug in cleanly.

> **Note:** DeltaKV compressor training code is maintained separately in
> [CURRENTF/DeltaKV](https://github.com/CURRENTF/DeltaKV). This repository only
> keeps the native DeltaKV inference implementation under `src/sparsevllm/`;
> it does not include DeltaKV training code or an HF reference implementation.

## Key Runtime Principles

- Runtime parameter names are identical across `LLM(...)`, `Config`, JSON
  configs, benchmark manifests, and internal consumers. Use `sparse_method`
  everywhere; legacy field aliases are not accepted.
- Sparse method runtime state belongs in
  `src/sparsevllm/engine/cache_manager/`; `attention.py` should stay generic.
- Prefill scheduling is method-specific and registry-owned. The source of
  truth is `src/sparsevllm/method_registry.py`, not benchmark scripts.
- Sparse-vLLM currently uses two prefill policies: `all_chunked` and the
  special `long_bs1full_short_batch` policy.
- `long_bs1full_short_batch` is only for methods that are registered to need a
  complete long-prefill pass before their sparse/cache transformation. Long
  requests run as full prefill with batch size 1; short requests still use
  chunked batching.
- Benchmark reports should record the sparse method, prefill policy, prefill
  chunk size, prompt length, batch size, and any DeltaKV checkpoint.

## Core Sparse Methods

Sparse-vLLM supports physical eviction, logical masking, query-aware selection,
and hybrid KV compression. The main method families are `streamingllm`,
`snapkv`, `h2o`, `pyramidkv`, `omnikv`, `quest`, `query_robust`, and `deltakv`.

| Method | Type | Short Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `vanilla` | Dense baseline | Runs full attention and keeps the standard KV cache behavior for correctness and performance baselines. |
| `streamingllm` / `attention-sink` | Physical eviction | Keeps fixed sink tokens plus a recent window, then physically evicts older tokens outside that policy. |
| `snapkv`, `pyramidkv` | Physical eviction | Selects important historical tokens during prefill/finalization and stores only the retained KV tokens. |
| `h2o` | Physical eviction | Maintains independent cumulative attention importance for every layer, then physically compacts each layer's KV rows using its own heavy-hitter selection plus a recent suffix. |
| `omnikv` | Logical masking | Keeps tokens in storage but masks the attention read view so sparse layers attend only selected context. |
| `quest` | Query-aware selection | Uses decode-time query-aware page selection while keeping prefill dense. |
| `query_robust` | Query-aware selection | Uses fixed, offline-calibrated query-hull page summaries and certified page-radius routing for explicit-KV decode. |
| `deltakv` / `deltakv-*` | Hybrid compression | Keeps a small full-precision pool and stores older context through DeltaKV compression or related ablations. |

Query-Robust's certificate is exact on the finite convex hull of its calibrated
post-RoPE decode-query vertices. With the default 64 vertices in a 128-dimensional
head space, that hull has measure zero; behavior on held-out serving queries is
an empirical generalization claim and requires calibration validation.

## Quick Start

Sparse-vLLM requires Python 3.10 or newer. The canonical CUDA 13 development
environment uses Python 3.12. Default dependencies are declared in
`pyproject.toml`.

### Conda

```bash
conda create -n sparse-vllm-cu130-py312 python=3.12 -y
conda activate sparse-vllm-cu130-py312

python -m pip config --site set global.extra-index-url \
  "https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu130 https://flashinfer.ai/whl/cu130"
python -m pip install "transformers==5.13.1" -e ".[cu130]"
python -m pip check

# Optional
MAX_JOBS=8 pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
pip install flashinfer-cubin --index-url https://flashinfer.ai/whl
```

PyTorch wheels include their CUDA runtime, while compiled extensions such as
`flash-attn` use the CUDA toolchain active in the environment.

### uv

```bash
uv venv --python 3.12
source .venv/bin/activate

uv pip install -e ".[cu130]"

# Optional
MAX_JOBS=8 uv pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
uv pip install flashinfer-cubin --index-url https://flashinfer.ai/whl
```

Use `cu129` instead of `cu130` for CUDA 12.9.

### Docker on NVIDIA Blackwell

`Dockerfile.b200` packages the CUDA 13.0 environment and the Query-Robust,
Quest, and ShadowKV implementations. It deliberately excludes model weights,
datasets, benchmark artifacts, and credentials; mount those at runtime.

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.b200 -t ihbkaiserdev/sparse-vllm:qr-b200 .
docker push ihbkaiserdev/sparse-vllm:qr-b200

docker run --rm --gpus all --ipc=host --shm-size=16g -it \
  -v /path/to/models:/models \
  -v /path/to/data:/data \
  -v /path/to/artifacts:/artifacts \
  ihbkaiserdev/sparse-vllm:qr-b200
```

The host needs a compatible NVIDIA driver, Docker, and the NVIDIA Container
Toolkit. Build the image on an x86_64 host; run it with `--gpus all` on the B200
host.

`einops`, `sglang-kernel==0.4.5`, and the training, benchmark, and test packages
are all part of the main installation; no workflow-specific extras are required.
The SGL kernel package is pinned because its compiled operators must match the
validated PyTorch/CUDA ABI; other versions are rejected during provider setup.
The CUDA extras also require FlashInfer. GPU engine startup fails with the
matching `pip install -e ".[cu129]"` or `pip install -e ".[cu130]"` repair hint
when either required kernel family is absent or broken.

Sparse-vLLM supports Qwen3.5/Qwen3.6/Qwen3.8 checkpoints in unquantized BF16
and block-scaled FP8 formats. These releases share the `qwen3_5` runtime
architecture and the same precision, parallelism, sparse-method, and
multimodal support.

Their prefill causal Conv1D and decode Conv1D/GDN packing paths use
repository-local Triton kernels; they do not call `sglang-kernel` themselves.

For the full dependency list and a minimal `LLM(...)` example, see
[Getting Started](docs/en/getting_started/README.md).

## Benchmarks

Use `scripts/benchmarks/bench_sparse_vllm.py` for throughput measurements and
the `benchmark/` entrypoints for LongBench, MathBench, SCBench, NIAH, and
multimodal evaluations.

See [Benchmarks](docs/en/benchmarking/README.md) for command examples and backend notes.

## Contributing Sparse Methods

New sparse methods should keep persistent physical cache state in
`src/sparsevllm/engine/cache_manager/`, keep logical orchestration behind a
`SparseMethodRuntime`, and keep `src/sparsevllm/layers/attention.py` generic.
See the [sparse method runtime architecture](docs/en/design/sparse-method-runtime.md).
