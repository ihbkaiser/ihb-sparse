# Sparse Method Runtime Architecture

This document defines the control-plane boundary for first-class sparse methods
in Sparse-vLLM. It is the architectural contract for adding a method, refactoring
an existing method, or integrating a model with native dynamic sparse attention.

The central rule is:

> A cache manager owns persistent physical cache state. A sparse method runtime
> owns logical score and selection orchestration. `SparseController` is the
> method-agnostic facade connecting those components to the inference engine.

This separation lets each method use a native storage and execution path without
adding method branches to the shared attention or scheduling hot paths.

## Architecture At A Glance

    E -. "activation-derived state" .-> E
    F -. "slots, pages, payloads, persistent metadata" .-> F
```

There are two stable interfaces:

1. The engine calls one `SparseController` interface regardless of method.
2. The controller delegates method semantics to one `SparseMethodRuntime`.

The cache manager remains a separate physical-storage abstraction. Runtime and
cache-manager inheritance are not required to match.

## Ownership Boundaries

| Component | Owns | Must not own |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `method_registry.py` | Canonical names, aliases, score contracts, schedule defaults, model/topology compatibility, prefix-cache and graph support, assets. | Mutable state, buffers, allocation policy. |
| `SparseController` | Stable engine-facing lifecycle, typed request/event construction, delegation to runtime and activation control. | Method-name hot-path branches or method algorithms. |
| `SparseMethodRuntime` | Per-step/per-layer logical state, score-buffer orchestration, cross-layer observation, logical selection, and compression/eviction triggers. | Physical slot ownership or persistent prefix-coupled cache metadata. |
| `ActivationController` | Hidden-state capture, activation reuse, and activation-derived cross-layer behavior. | KV allocation and physical cache views. |
| `CacheManager` | Physical KV or latent storage, slots/pages/pools, persistent method metadata, allocation, compaction, reconstruction, prefix lifecycle, and typed compute-view construction. | Scheduler policy or model-layer method branches. |
| `MemoryOracle` / `RuntimeState` | Capacity, reservation, execution-mode, and admission facts exposed to scheduling. | Method algorithms. |
| `Attention` | Generic store, view request, provider invocation, and lifecycle hooks. | Sparse-method names, policy, or persistent state. |
| Operator/provider | Prepared compute implementation and workspaces for its declared typed contract. | Method policy, cache allocation, or silent semantic fallback. |

State ownership is determined by lifetime and semantics, not convenience:

- If state must survive append, prefix attach, fork, restore, rollback, offload,
  or free, it is cache-coupled persistent state and belongs in `CacheManager`.
- If state is rebuilt for the current forward step or propagates a selection
  between layers, it belongs in `SparseMethodRuntime`.
- If state is derived from hidden activations rather than cache payloads, it
  belongs in `ActivationController`.
- If a decision affects admission or batching, expose it through a generic
  scheduler-facing contract rather than reading the method name.

## The Public Controller Facade

`src/sparsevllm/engine/sparse_controller.py` intentionally stays small. Its
engine-facing lifecycle is:

```python
class SparseController:
    def prepare_forward(self, seqs, is_prefill): ...
    def get_prefill_selection(self, layer_idx): ...
    def get_decode_selection(self, layer_idx, query): ...
    def on_layer_attention_end(self, layer_idx): ...
    def on_layer_end(self, layer_idx, context): ...
    def post_forward(self, seqs, is_prefill): ...
```

It also combines activation/runtime CUDA Graph keepalive state, resets runtime
score buffers for capture, exposes debug summaries, and forwards tokenizer
metadata to `ActivationController`.

Do not add a branch such as `if sparse_method == ...` to this facade. A method
change should be represented by a runtime implementation, a typed cache-manager
hook, or another narrow owner-specific interface.

## The Method Runtime Contract

`src/sparsevllm/engine/sparse_methods/base.py` defines typed lifecycle inputs:

- `SparseStepContext`
- `PrefillSelectionRequest`
- `DecodeSelectionRequest`
- `AttentionEndEvent`
- `LayerEndEvent`

`SparseMethodRuntime` provides common per-layer state preparation and score
workspace behavior. Implementations define the semantic hooks they need:

| Hook | Timing | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `prepare_step` | Before model layers | Refresh current batch metadata and prepare score/selection workspaces. |
| `needs_attention_score` | During preparation | Declare whether a layer needs a score buffer for this step. |
| `build_prefill_selection` | Before prefill attention | Produce the logical selection consumed by the cache manager. |
| `build_decode_selection` | Before decode attention | Produce the logical selection; the current query is available when needed. |
| `on_attention_end` | Immediately after attention | Finalize score materialization that depends on attention completion. |
| `on_layer_end` | At the model layer boundary | Normalize scores and propagate cross-layer selections. |
| `finish_step` | After model forward | Trigger method-owned logical finalization or cache-manager physical mutation. |
| graph/debug hooks | Capture, replay, diagnostics | Preserve workspace identity, reset captured inputs, and expose logical state. |

`LayerBatchSparseState` is current-step logical state. It may reference stable
cache-manager tensors, but it does not take ownership of their physical
lifetime.

## Runtime Construction And Reuse

`engine/sparse_methods/factory.py` maps canonical methods to runtime classes at
construction time. Runtime dispatch must not perform registry lookup or method
string selection inside the per-layer hot path.

The runtime hierarchy is deliberately shallow and organized by shared
mechanics:

| Runtime mechanism | Current methods | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PassThroughRuntime` | vanilla, QuEST, Query-Robust | Controller selection is full; any native query-aware physical view remains cache-manager/provider owned. |
| `StreamingLLMRuntime` | StreamingLLM | Pass-through attention view followed by physical sink/recent retention. |
| `ScoredCompactionRuntime` | SnapKV, PyramidKV | Shared score lifecycle and physical compaction; PyramidKV specializes layer budgets and triggers. |
| `H2ORuntime` | H2O | H2O-specific prefill score workspace and cache-owned cumulative importance/eviction lifecycle. |
| `JointDecodeRuntime` | R-KV, SkipKV | Shared decode compaction pipeline with different score sources and selectors. |
| `DynamicSelectionRuntime` | OmniKV, DeltaKV | Observation-layer scoring and cross-layer dynamic selection; physical payload semantics remain method-specific. |

Subclass a runtime only when its score representation, trigger order, selection
domain, mutation order, prefix behavior, and CUDA Graph workspace lifecycle
actually match. Otherwise add a separate runtime and share only a narrow helper.

Cache managers use their own inheritance structure because physical allocation,
storage layout, prefix lifecycle, and `MemoryOracle` behavior form a different
axis of reuse. A runtime class and a cache-manager class do not need a one-to-one
inheritance relationship.

## Selection And Compute-View Boundary

The data plane follows this sequence:

1. Runtime produces a typed `SparseSelection`.
2. `Attention` passes the selection and current query/KV inputs to
   `CacheManager`.
3. `CacheManager` resolves logical indices into physical slots, pages, latent
   payloads, or reconstructed temporary storage.
4. `CacheManager` returns a typed `PrefillComputeView` or `DecodeComputeView`.
5. A prepared provider consumes the view without inspecting the sparse method.

Use the existing data-plane types:

- `SparseSelection` for logical selection;
- `AttentionViewMeta` or `PagedDecodeViewMeta` for physical coordinates;
- `PrefillComputeView` and `DecodeComputeView` for execution-time views;
- `ExplicitKVPayload` and `MlaLatentPayload` for storage payloads.

Do not pass method-specific tuples, config objects, hidden side-channel tensors,
or method names through `layers/attention.py`.

QuEST demonstrates an important case: its runtime returns the ordinary full
logical selection, while `QuestCacheManager` and the selection provider use the
current query to construct the native paged view. The runtime should not copy
persistent page metadata merely to make the method look controller-owned.

## Prefix Cache And CUDA Graph

Prefix-cache support is a physical-state contract, not a controller feature.
Every persistent method tensor must follow the same allocate, append, attach,
fork, restore/rollback, eviction/offload, and free lifecycle as the KV payload it
describes. That ownership remains behind the cache-manager interface.

Runtime logical state is rebuilt from cache-manager batch state after prefix
attachment. A runtime must not retain sequence-owned physical metadata that can
become stale after ownership transfer.

Runtime-owned CUDA Graph buffers are allowed when they are logical score or
selection workspaces. Supported graph runtimes must:

- allocate graph-stable workspaces before capture;
- expose them through `decode_graph_keepalive_tensors`;
- reset captured score inputs through the typed graph reset hook;
- avoid allocation, registry lookup, or Python shape-dependent fallback during
  replay;
- preserve eager and graph selection/output semantics.

## Integrating A New Method Or Native DSA Model

Use this dependency order:

1. Declare canonical identity and static capabilities in config and
   `method_registry.py`.
2. Validate model layout, storage representation, topology, providers, and
   unsupported combinations.
3. Implement persistent physical state and lifecycle behavior in a cache
   manager or storage owner.
4. Select or add a `SparseMethodRuntime` for score/selection orchestration and
   register it in the runtime factory.
5. Return typed selections and compute views across the attention boundary.
6. Expose capacity, temporary reservation, and execution-mode requirements
   through `MemoryOracle`/`RuntimeState`.
7. Integrate activation control or operators only when the declared semantics
   require them.
8. Validate prefix cache and CUDA Graph for every capability advertised by the
   registry.

For a model with native dynamic sparse attention (DSA), first identify whether
the model exposes routed token indices, query-dependent page selection,
compressed/latent payloads, or persistent routing metadata. Route each part to
the same owners:

- model/layout code defines stable operator and storage semantics;
- runtime coordinates logical scoring and cross-layer selection;
- cache manager owns physical storage and persistent metadata;
- provider consumes a typed view or model-native payload;
- scheduler sees only generic capacity and execution constraints.

Do not encode a model-native DSA path as branches in `Attention`, `ModelRunner`,
or `Scheduler`. If the current types cannot express its payload, extend the
narrow typed boundary rather than bypassing it.

## Review And Validation Invariants

A sparse-method change is incomplete until all relevant invariants hold:

- `SparseController`, `Attention`, `ModelRunner`, and `Scheduler` contain no new
  method-name hot-path branches.
- Persistent cache metadata and slot lifetime remain cache-manager owned.
- Runtime factory construction is explicit and auditable.
- Score shape, dtype, fill value, normalization, reduction order, Top-K tie
  behavior, trigger boundary, and mutation order match the method contract.
- Prefix cold/hit/append/fork/restore/free paths are covered where advertised.
- Eager and CUDA Graph paths preserve buffer identity and numerical behavior.
- Deterministic generation matches the reference before quality evaluation.
- Performance uses matched traces, providers, budgets, and validated artifacts
  from the efficiency runbook.

Use the repository-local `$add-sparse-method` skill for the complete integration
and validation workflow.
